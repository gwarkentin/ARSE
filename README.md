# ARSE (Augmented Reality Shopping Experience)

ARSE is a customer-facing ecommerce mobile app to improve the at-home and in-store shopping experience by utilizing AR technology.
The goal is to implement AR technology in order to provide users with a easy-to-use application that does not overwhelm the user with excessive information, while making sure that important information for each product is conveyed.

Bringing Augmented Reaily to the in-store retail shopping customer by:
 - Making it intuitive for the customer to gather relevant information
 - Helping customer to visually filter out products in store to make it easier to find and compare relevent products only
 - Helping products to stand out in a sea of similar looking devices
 - Showcasing features immersively via Augmented Reality
 - Seamlessly integrating with ERP, CMS, and eCommerce platforms
